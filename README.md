#  PrepLink

> **AI-powered interview preparation platform**  
> Structured, personalised, and focused interview prep — all in one place.

---

## 🚧 Project Status: In Active Development

PrepLink is currently **under development**.  
Core authentication, backend architecture, and data models are being actively built.

Features, UI, and APIs are evolving rapidly — expect breaking changes.

---

## ✨ What is PrepLink?

PrepLink is an **AI-assisted interview preparation platform** designed to help candidates:

- Organise interview prep by **company & role**
- Practice **custom interview questions**
- Get structured, role-specific insights instead of generic prep material

The goal is to move beyond generic Q&A — and provide a **centralised, intelligent prep workspace**.

---

## 🔍 Problem It Solves

Most candidates get generic AI interview prep with little company or role context.

### PrepLink solves this by:
**PrepLink** creates **company- and role-specific interview preparation** by combining:
- Job description
- Candidate resume
- Company specific data

This results in tailored **interview questions & answers, preparation tips, and company insights** — instead of generic AI responses.
